#personal website

This website is completely programmed by me and is in own use to represent myself or showcase to sponsors and the world.
I use it to keep people updated and share my eperiences as well as adventures as an upcoming professional athlete.

My goal is to become either a full professional athlete or a software engineer. This is all I am capable of for now. This project will respresent my abilities after 1 year of learning on my own besides sport (20h per week) and school.
Feel free to send me feedback on my work.
